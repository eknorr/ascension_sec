IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING

Exploits such as rogue PHP functions and 
new administrative accounts may live in your database, 
as well as spam (e.g. hidden ads for pharmaceuticals).

This means that even a completely clean WP install (with no themes, no content, etc.) 
would still contain the hack. The magic was in a couple of nefarious ‘RewriteRules’ added to the main 
.htaccess file that routed all traffic to the site through an innocuously named “images.php” file.
The safest route is to delete your .htaccess file (after taking note of any additions you’ve put in there like 301 redirects) 
and then go to WordPress Settings:Permalinks to recreate your .htaccess file anew
